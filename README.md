# Beluga-TELEMAC-MASCARET
The Beluga branch of the source code is being developed to take these meteorological conditions into account through NetCDF files

The development of the Beluga branch of the TELEMAC source code aims to impose meteorological forcing through NetCDF files. Provided they fulfil the Climate and Forecast (CF) convention, doing so ensures that the forcing files are self-describing. In practical terms, the user defines the NetCDF file in the steering file, and the data are interpolated in space and time by TELEMAC to provide meteorological conditions at each grid node and at each time step.
